\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with
factors such as lifestyle choices, genetics, and socio-economic status contributing to their prevalence. Early detection and prediction of heart diseases play a crucial role in reducing morbidity and mortality rates associated with CVDs.
\section{objective}
The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various risk factors. By achieving this, we aim to contribute to early detection efforts and improve healthcare outcomes related to cardiovascular health.

\section{cardiovascular diseases and risk factor}
Cardiovascular diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure. Key risk factors identified in the literature include age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes
mellitus, smoking, and family history.
